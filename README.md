as we know traffic is the major problem which every country faces because of the increase in number of vehicles throughout the world, particularly in large urban areas, As the problem of urban traffic congestion spreads and occurrence of road accidents increase, there is a pressing need for the introduction of advanced technology and equipment to improve the traffic control algorithms to better accommodate the increasing demand, the simplest way for controlling a traffic light is using timer for each phase, in this repusitry I propose the simulation model for controlling the traffic lights based on time interval this simulation model can extended to control the time interval of the traffic light based on traffic density system for controlling the traffic light by computer vision the system will detect the vehicles through images embedded in the pavement a camera will installed alongside the traffic light it will capture image sequence the image sequence will then be analyze using digital image processing for vehicle detection and according to traffic condition on the road traffic light can be controlled, this system is not only controlling one junction but it is controlling all the junctions that are found in a city by connecting them with fiber cable so that they will communicate with each other and then there will no more traffic jam in the city.
check the files using the video file name called video.mp4 I hope you will enjoy it.
